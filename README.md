# Angular Pong Game

Run `npm run start` to start frontend dev server and `npm run server-dev` to start backend/socket server

The pong game could be played with up to 4 players connected via socket. 

The game is infinite and was made just for fun, so you can join it or disconnect from the server whenever you want.
